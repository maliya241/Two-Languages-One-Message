          <p class="aboutp">
            In 2012, a coworker and I took on the daunting task of creating Bible curriculum for the Nicaragua Christian School in León, Nicaragua. That same year, Stephanie became involved to help us translate and was impressed with our dream of creating a Bible curriculum in English and Spanish that could be put online for free for anyone to use. 
            </p>
            <p class="aboutp">
            We did some research ourselves looking for free curriculum online that was in Spanish and found very little! We spent a lot of time piecing together whatever we could find as well as writing some of our own curriculum throughout the years as we tried to provide our best for the school in Nicaragua.

            <p class="aboutp">
              Now that we’ve done this for a few years, we are ready to start putting some things we’ve created online! We’re also including extra links to web pages that offer books or curriculum for decent prices as well as other resources. 
            </p>
            <p class="aboutp">
              We’d love to hear from you to find out how you’re planning to use the material! We’re hopeful that this will be a great resource for you and will bring the gospel to many people of all ages!
